One of my places of worship. Instead of prayers, though, I say thank yous.

# **To William Cuthbert Faulkner...**

{{ center_image(path="wcf.webp", desc="... for giving the best acceptance speech. I wouldn't be able to name anyone else who has shown me just as clearly what writing ought to be and what the purpose of a poet's voice is. Thank you.", link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOg30JBnik8") }}

# **To Clifford Paul Stoll...**

{{ center_image(path="cps.webp", desc="... for giving the best TED talk. I didn't think one could bask so unapologetically in all of one's glorious nerdiness. I could'nt imagine one being so free. Thank you.", link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj8IA6xOpSk") }}

# **To David Foster Wallace...**

{{ center_image(path="dfw.webp", desc="... for giving the best commencement speech. None of the other ones resonated with me as deeply. I feel so fortunate it was the very first one I've heard right before graduating high school. Thank you.", link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCbGM4mqEVw") }}

# **To Randolph Frederick Pausch...**

{{ center_image(path="rfp.webp", desc="... for giving the best lifetime speech. This one's a tough one. I don't think I could ever go through it without tearing up, both of hysterical laughter and of overwhelming emotion. Thank you.", link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo") }}

# **Thank you all for sharing your stories, and for living your lives to tell them.**
