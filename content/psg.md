Contrary to common thinking life is actually a win-win game.

What about entropy, though? The steady universal increase of chaos is a physical law, right? Wrong!

While it is true that entropy is increasing overall across the Universe, that doesn't mean it can't drop here and there once in while!

Similarly, you can scratch your first intuition of a human life being a negative or zero-sum game and enjoy yourself harvesting negative entropy on this rocky ripple in spacetime we call Earth!

<!-- The Fool vs The World -->

- ## **Know Thyself**

Figure out what you're good at and how to make that useful to others, especially the ones you care about. Be cautious about stressing for the whole world, though. You most probably don't need to, but more importantly, it will be destructive. And hardly in a good way.

<!-- The Magician vs Judgement -->

- ## **Live to Be Your Best Self**

Being kind sounds simple but gets pretty close to impossible when you're in pain yourself. Resist to the very end the assumption that the person next to you is out to hurt you. You never know what someone is going through. Yes, especially when you think that you really do.

<!-- The Priestess vs The Sun -->

- ## **Expand Your Horizons**

Explore the world to its very limits. Be conscious of the happiness, the hardship, and the horror. Let your heart be swayed by neither.

<!-- The Queen vs The Moon -->

- ## **Stay Consistent Day-in Day-out**

Adapt your environment to accommodate your daily grind. Learn to stay in the flow state for longer at a time. Think of it as another form of meditation.

<!-- The King vs The Star -->

- ## **Focus on What You Can Change**

There's only so much you can do right now. You know what it is, too. To put it into the words of a renowned classic: "JUST DO IT!"

<!-- The Priest vs The Tower -->

- ## **State Your Positions**

Have a clear and thorough position on a variety of subjects, especially on those directly affecting your life.

<!-- The Lovers vs The Devil -->

- ## **Find Your Partner**

Hard to give any concrete guidance here apart from: when you fall in love there won't be any doubt in your mind about it. You'll be willing to know that person as much as, if not more than, you know yourself.

<!-- The Chariot vs Temperance -->

- ## **Learn to Loosen the Reins**

Practice the art of letting go. Let the chance play into your game. Be comfortable with it.

<!-- Justice vs Death -->

- ## **Demand More of Yourself**

You're capable of so much more if you stay composed and persistent. Your attitude will determine whether you succeed or fail.

<!-- The Hermit vs The Sacrifice -->

- ## **Choose Your People**

Stay away from the wrong crowd. Bad social influence is hard enough to recognize and even harder to uproot. Don't prolong your social withdrawal phases. Always be looking to connect with others.

<!-- Fortune vs Fortitude -->

- ## **Remain Formidable Despite the Fortunes**

Predict the future as far out as possible, but always be ready for a sudden turn of events. Prepare yourself in advance to make sure no potential circumstance can knock you off balance. Value what you've achieved, but don't let it define your next step. Lastly, just like remembering to reflect on every down, don't forget to celebrate every up, too.
