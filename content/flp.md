### **E**ve of Christmas first-born,

### **l**ow-key bearing world-champion

### **i**ntellect and frame of mind,

### **z**ealous to keep on being kind,

### **a**ngel's beloved eldest child.

### **L**atina goddess, rockstar queen blessed for

### **a**ll of time to look her best, and most

### **B**eautiful. For nothing in the world could more

### **e**nhance nor harm her nature's gifts: no

### **l**ip gloss, eye shadow, or hair dye, so

### **l**ong as tears of love the tears of long

### **e**ndure and care to catch her in the rye.
