Yep, I'm in love with her.

### **E**ve of Christmas first-born,

### **l**ow-key bearing world-champion

### **i**ntelligence and frame of mind,

### **z**ealous to keep on being kind,

### **a**ngel's beloved eldest child.

### **L**atina goddess, rockstar queen blessed for

### **a**ll of time to look her best and most

### **B**eautiful! For nothing in the world could more

### **e**nhance nor harm her nature's gifts: no

### **l**ip gloss, eye shadows, nor hair dye, so

### **l**ong as wears of love the tears of long

### **e**ndure and care to catch her in the rye.
