## Sports background

First, I did swimming for 4 years, played tennis for another 4, then stuck with weight-lifting for 8 more. For the past 4 years I've been going cardio-only.

Lately, I got into cheer stunting. Only brushing up on my theory for now and dreaming of stunting with [the best of the best](@/csg.md)!
