## Sports background

First, I did swimming for 4 years, then played tennis for another 4, then stuck with weight-lifting for 8 more. For the past 4 years I've been going cardio-only, though.

Lately, I got into cheer stunting, only brushing up on my theory for now and dreaming of stunting with [these guys](@/csg.md).
