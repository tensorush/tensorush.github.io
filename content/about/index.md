## Sports

First, I did swimming for 4 years, then played tennis for another 4, then stuck with weight-lifting for 8 more.

I've been going cardio-only (swimming, running, rope-jumping) for the past 4 years.

Lately, I've been into [cheer stunting](https://tensorush.github.io/csg.html), only brushing up on my theory, though.
