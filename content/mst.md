This is a 180 spin on the Clarke's third law:

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".

It doesn't really change the original meaning, but it does change the emphasis, the viewpoint, suggesting that any impossible fantasy is only a step away from becoming hard-boiled sci-fi. That step being to introduce a scientifically plausible mechanism, a technology, behind every magic.
