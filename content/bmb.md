Brief summary of my background.

# **General**

Check out my [CV](https://tensorush.github.io/cv/en.pdf) for the relevant academics, jobs, projects, and socials.

# **Sports**

First, I did swimming for 4 years, played tennis for another 4, then stuck with weight-lifting for 8 more. For the past 4 years I've been mixing cardio, stretching, and calisthenics.

Lately, I got into [cheer](@/cns.md), too. Just brushing up on my theory for now and dreaming of stunting with [these elite folks](@/csg.md)!

# **Handle**

Started diving into programming around the summer of 2020 by studying all things AI. The idea that any computation could be modelled as a [tensor product](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-tensor-product-demystified) stuck with me, so I made up a word for it from my last name "Trush", read as "Troosh", with "T" being a common way to denote a tensor. Unlike my last name, however, "tensorush" reads the usual way, as in "gold rush" or "adrenaline rush".

# **Coding**

Here's the timeline of my programming/typesetting/markdown language exploration journey so far:

- ## **2018**: [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

- ## **2019**: [R](https://www.r-project.org/) -> [Python](https://www.python.org/)

- ## **2020**: [Python](https://www.python.org/) -> [TeX](https://tug.org/) -> [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)

- ## **2021**: [Julia](https://julialang.org/) -> [C/C++](https://cplusplus.com/) -> [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) -> [Nix](https://nixos.org/)

- ## **2022**: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) -> [x86/ARM Assembly](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html) -> [Forth](https://www.forthlang.org/) -> [Swift](https://www.swift.org/)

- ## **2023**: [Go](https://go.dev/) -> [Typst](https://typst.app/) -> [HTML/CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) -> [Wasm Interface Type](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html) -> [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo)
