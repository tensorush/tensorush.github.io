Short summary of my background.

# **General**

Check out my [CV](https://tensorush.github.io/cv/en.pdf) for all of the academics, jobs, projects, and socials.

# **Sports**

First, I did swimming for 4 years, played tennis for another 4, then stuck with weight-lifting for 8 more. For the past 4 years I've been mixing cardio, stretching and calisthenics.

Lately, I got into [cheer](@/cns.md), too. Just brushing up on my theory for now and dreaming of [stunting with these elite folks](@/csg.md)!

# **Handle**

Started diving into programming during the summer of 2020, at the age of 22, by studying all things AI. The idea that any computation could be modelled as a tensor product stuck with me, so I made up a word for it from my last name "Trush", read as "Troosh", with "T" being a common way to denote a tensor. Unlike my last name, however, "tensorush" reads the usual way, as in "gold rush" or "adrenaline rush".
